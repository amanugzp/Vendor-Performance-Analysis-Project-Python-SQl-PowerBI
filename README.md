# üì¶Project: Vendor Performance Analysis

A data-driven project focused on analyzing vendor and brand performance to uncover insights that help businesses make smarter procurement, pricing, and inventory decisions.

---

## üìå Project Objective:

The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of vendors and brands using key metrics such as sales performance, profit margins, inventory turnover, purchase patterns, and cost efficiency. By solving real-world business questions, the analysis delivers actionable recommendations to optimize vendor selection, reduce capital lock-in, and enhance profitability.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Python was used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using libraries like:
- **pandas** for data manipulation and merging datasets
- **numpy** for numerical operations
- **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for data visualization
- **scipy.stats** for statistical analysis (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing)     

- **MySQL**: Store and manage large datasets efficiently, especially the high-volume sales.csv file and SQL-based exploration
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and uncover initial insights.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Source

The dataset was part of a real-world business simulation and includes six interconnected CSV files (simulating a vendor database).  
Data includes:
- Vendor invoices
- Purchase pricing
- Begin and end inventory
- Purchase orders
- Sales data

## ‚≠ê Key Features / Highlights

- **Business Problem:**  
  The company lacked insights into vendor and brand-level performance, leading to poor inventory decisions, pricing inefficiencies, and supply chain risk.

- **Core Business Questions Solved:**  
  1. Which brands need promotional or pricing adjustments due to low sales but high margins?  
  2. Who are the top-performing vendors and brands in terms of sales?  
  3. Which vendors account for the largest portion of purchase dollars?  
  4. How dependent is the business on its top vendors?  
  5. Does bulk purchasing reduce unit price, and what is the optimal volume?  
  6. Which vendors have low inventory turnover (slow-moving stock)?  
  7. How much capital is locked in unsold inventory per vendor?  
  8. What are the 95% confidence intervals of profit margins across vendor groups?  
  9. Is there a statistically significant difference in profitability between top and low-performing vendors?

- **Visual Walkthroughs:**  
  The project includes scatter plots, bar graphs, statistical tables, and correlation heatmaps to support every insight visually.

- **Business Impact & Insights:**  
  - Identified $2.71M in locked inventory capital  
  - Found top 10 vendors account for ~66% of total purchase value  
  - Vendors purchasing in bulk save ~72% in unit cost  
  - Confirmed statistical difference in profit margins across vendor segments  
  - Delivered data-backed recommendations to reduce risk, improve pricing, and drive sales growth

## üìå Final Recommendations

- Adjust pricing and promotions for low-sales, high-margin brands  
- Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply chain risk  
- Leverage bulk buying to reduce cost per unit  
- Improve sales & distribution efforts for underperforming vendors  
- Use statistical models to guide strategic vendor and pricing decisions
